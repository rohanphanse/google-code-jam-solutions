# Google Code Jam Solutions

Improving my competitive programming skills and knowledge of algorithms + advanced data structures by solving [Google Code Jam 2022](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive/2022). Using Rust, a beautiful and powerful memory-safe language.

## My Solutions
Qualification Round ([all prompts](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000876ff1)):

1. Punched Cards ([solution](https://github.com/rohanphanse/google-code-jam-solutions/blob/main/punched-cards/src/main.rs))
2. 3D Printing ([solution](https://github.com/rohanphanse/google-code-jam-solutions/blob/main/three-printing/src/main.rs))
3. 
4. Chain Reactions ([solution](https://github.com/rohanphanse/google-code-jam-solutions/blob/main/chain-reactions/src/main.rs))

## Chain Reactions
Solving 'Chain Reactions' was extremely difficult for me, but equally as rewarding when I finally cracked it. I modeled the problem as a forest of trees and recursively accumulated the 'maximum fun' by traversing each tree with depth first search.
